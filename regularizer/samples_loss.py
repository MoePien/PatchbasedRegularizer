#
# Here, a semi-unbalanced case is included. Therefore, some functions are
# modified. More specifically, we modified the function geomloss.sinkhorn_divergence.scaling_parameters
# for the semi-unbalanced case (scaling_parameters_su, ll. 60-74).
# Based on that, we redefine the functions geomloss.sinkhorn_samples.sinkhorn_tensorized
# and geomloss.sinkhorn_samples.sinkhorn_online in ll. 84-231 and ll. 241-317, 
# respectively, where we use the defined function scaling_parameters_su.
# Different parameters for the semi-unbalanced case (rho) are incorporated 
# in the function geomloss.sinkhorn_divergence.sinkhorn_cost, which is 
# modified in ll. 323-402.
# These different parameters need to be used for the iterates in 
# geomloss.sinkhorn_divergence.sinkhorn_loop. The modified function is 
# defined in ll. 409-784.
# Finally, the function geomloss.samples_loss.SamplesLoss is redefined 
# in ll. 817-1246 with the use of the newly defined functions sinkhorn_tensorized_su 
# and sinkhorn_online_su. 
#
# Specific changes of each function are explained above the functions.
# The main difference consists in the change of the unbalancing parameter
# rho from a single parameter to a list of two parameters.

    Args:
        a ((B, N) Tensor): Weights :math:`\alpha_i` for the first measure,
            with a batch dimension.

        x ((B, N, D) Tensor): Sampling locations :math:`x_i` for the first measure,
            with a batch dimension.

        b ((B, M) Tensor): Weights :math:`\beta_j` for the second measure,
            with a batch dimension.

        y ((B, M, D) Tensor): Sampling locations :math:`y_j` for the second measure,
            with a batch dimension.

        p (int, optional): Exponent of the ground cost function
            :math:`C(x_i,y_j)`, which is equal to
            :math:`\tfrac{1}{p}\|x_i-y_j\|^p` if it is not provided
            explicitly through the `cost` optional argument.
            Defaults to 2.

        blur (float, optional): Target value for the blurring scale
            of the Gibbs kernel
            :math:`K_{i,j} = \exp(-C(x_i,y_j)/\varepsilon) = \exp(-\|x_i-y_j\|^p / p \text{blur}^p).
            In the Sinkhorn algorithm, the temperature :math:`\varepsilon`
            is computed as :math:`\text{blur}^p`.
            Defaults to 0.05.

        reach (float or None (= +infty), optional): Typical scale for the
            maximum displacement between any two points :math:`x_i` and :math:`y_j`
            in the optimal transport model.
            In the unbalanced Sinkhorn divergence,
            the strength :math:`\rho` of the soft marginal constraints
            is computed as :math:`\rho = \text{reach}^p`.
            Defaults to None.

        diameter (float or None, optional): Upper bound on the value
            of the distance :math:`\|x_i-y_j\|` between any two samples.
            This will be used as a first value of the `blur` radius
            in the epsilon-scaling annealing descent.
            Defaults to None: an upper bound will be estimated on the fly.

        scaling (float in (0, 1), optional): Ratio between two successive
            values of the blur radius in the epsilon-scaling annealing descent.
            Defaults to 0.5.

        cost (function, optional): Cost function :math:`C(x_i,y_j)`.
            It should take as input two point clouds `x` and `y`
            with a batch dimension, encoded as `(B, N, D)`, `(B, M, D)`
            torch Tensors and return a `(B, N, M)` torch Tensor.
            Defaults to None: we use a Euclidean cost
            :math:`C(x_i,y_j) = \tfrac{1}{p}\|x_i-y_j\|^p`.

        debias (bool, optional): Should we used the "de-biased" Sinkhorn divergence
            :math:`\text{S}_{\varepsilon, \rho}(\al,\be)` instead
            of the "raw" entropic OT cost
            :math:`\text{OT}_{\varepsilon, \rho}(\al,\be)`?
            This slows down the OT solver but guarantees that our approximation
            of the Wasserstein distance will be positive and definite
            - up to convergence of the Sinkhorn loop.
            For a detailed discussion of the influence of this parameter,
            see e.g. Fig. 3.21 in Jean Feydy's PhD thesis.
            Defaults to True.

        potentials (bool, optional): Should we return the optimal dual potentials
            instead of the cost value?
            Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        (B,) Tensor or pair of (B, N), (B, M) Tensors: if `potentials` is True,
            we return a pair of (B, N), (B, M) Tensors that encode the optimal dual vectors,
            respectively supported by :math:`x_i` and :math:`y_j`.
            Otherwise, we return a (B,) Tensor of values for the Sinkhorn divergence.

    This is the main "core" routine of GeomLoss. It is written to
    solve optimal transport problems efficiently in all the settings
    that are supported by the library: (generalized) point clouds,
    images and volumes.

    This algorithm is described in Section 3.3.3 of Jean Feydy's PhD thesis,
    "Geometric data analysis, beyond convolutions" (Universite Paris-Saclay, 2020)
    (https://www.jeanfeydy.com/geometric_data_analysis.pdf).
    Algorithm 3.5 corresponds to the case where `kernel_truncation` is None,
    while Algorithm 3.6 describes the full multiscale algorithm.

    Args:
        softmin (function): This routine must implement the (soft-)C-transform
            between dual vectors, which is the core computation for
            Auction- and Sinkhorn-like optimal transport solvers.
            If `eps` is a float number, `C_xy` encodes a cost matrix :math:`C(x_i,y_j)`
            and `g` encodes a dual potential :math:`g_j` that is supported by the points
            :math:`y_j`'s, then `softmin(eps, C_xy, g)` must return a dual potential
            `f` for ":math:`f_i`", supported by the :math:`x_i`'s, that is equal to:

            :math:`C(y_i, y_j)` between the samples of the second input
            measure at different scales.
            These will be passed to the `softmin` function as second arguments.

            measures at different scales.
            These will be passed to the `softmin` function as second arguments.

            measures at different scales.
            These will be passed to the `softmin` function as second arguments.

        eps_list (list of float): List of successive values for the temperature
            :math:`\varepsilon`. The number of iterations in the loop
            is equal to the length of this list.

        rho (float or None): Strength of the marginal constraints for unbalanced OT.
            None stands for :math:`\rho = +\infty`, i.e. balanced OT.

        jumps (list, optional): List of iteration numbers where we "jump"
            from a coarse resolution to a finer one by looking
            one step further in the lists `a_logs`, `b_logs`, `C_xxs`, etc.
            Count starts at iteration 0.
            Defaults to [] - single-scale mode without jumps.

        kernel_truncation (function, optional): Implements the kernel truncation trick.
            Defaults to None.

        truncate (int, optional): Optional argument for `kernel_truncation`.
            Defaults to 5.

        cost (string or function, optional): Optional argument for `kernel_truncation`.
            Defaults to None.

        extrapolate (function, optional): Function.
            If
            `f_ba` is a dual potential that is supported by the :math:`x_i`'s,
            `g_ab` is a dual potential that is supported by the :math:`y_j`'s,
            `eps` is the current value of the temperature :math:`\varepsilon`,
            `damping` is the current value of the damping coefficient for unbalanced OT,
            `C_xy` encodes the cost matrix :math:`C(x_i, y_j)` at the current
            ("coarse") resolution,
            `b_log` denotes the log-weights :math:`\log(\beta_j)`
            that are supported by the :math:`y_j`'s at the coarse resolution,
            and
            `C_xy_fine` encodes the cost matrix :math:`C(x_i, y_j)` at the next
            ("fine") resolution,
            then
            `extrapolate(f_ba, g_ab, eps, damping, C_xy, b_log, C_xy_fine)`
            will be used to compute the new values of the dual potential
            `f_ba` on the point cloud :math:`x_i` at a finer resolution.
            Defaults to None - it is not needed in single-scale mode.

        debias (bool, optional): Should we used the "de-biased" Sinkhorn divergence
            :math:`\text{S}_{\varepsilon, \rho}(\al,\be)` instead
            of the "raw" entropic OT cost
            :math:`\text{OT}_{\varepsilon, \rho}(\al,\be)`?
            This slows down the OT solver but guarantees that our approximation
            of the Wasserstein distance will be positive and definite
            - up to convergence of the Sinkhorn loop.
            For a detailed discussion of the influence of this parameter,
            see e.g. Fig. 3.21 in Jean Feydy's PhD thesis.
            Defaults to True.

        last_extrapolation (bool, optional): Should we perform a last, "full"
            Sinkhorn iteration before returning the dual potentials?
            This allows us to retrieve correct gradients without having
            to backpropagate trough the full Sinkhorn loop.
            Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        4-uple of Tensors: The four optimal dual potentials
            `(f_aa, g_bb, g_ab, f_ba)` that are respectively

                between the ICP loss (blur=0) and a kernel distance (blur= :math:`+\infty` ).
              - ``"energy"``: Energy Distance MMD, computed using the kernel
                :math:`k(x,y) = -\|x-y\|_2`.
              - ``"gaussian"``: Gaussian MMD, computed using the kernel
                :math:`k(x,y) = \exp \\big( -\|x-y\|_2^2 \,/\, 2\sigma^2)`
                of standard deviation :math:`\sigma` = **blur**.
              - ``"laplacian"``: Laplacian MMD, computed using the kernel
                :math:`k(x,y) = \exp \\big( -\|x-y\|_2 \,/\, \sigma)`
                of standard deviation :math:`\sigma` = **blur**.

        p (int, default=2): If **loss** is ``"sinkhorn"`` or ``"hausdorff"``,
            specifies the ground cost function between points.
            The supported values are:

              - **p** = 1: :math:`~~C(x,y) ~=~ \|x-y\|_2`.
              - **p** = 2: :math:`~~C(x,y) ~=~ \\tfrac{1}{2}\|x-y\|_2^2`.

        blur (float, default=.05): The finest level of detail that
            should be handled by the loss function - in
            order to prevent overfitting on the samples' locations.

            - If **loss** is ``"gaussian"`` or ``"laplacian"``,
              it is the standard deviation :math:`\sigma` of the convolution kernel.
            - If **loss** is ``"sinkhorn"`` or ``"hausdorff"``,
              it is the typical scale :math:`\sigma` associated
              to the temperature :math:`\\varepsilon = \sigma^p`.
              The default value of .05 is sensible for input
              measures that lie in the unit square/cube.

            Note that the *Energy Distance* is scale-equivariant, and won't
            be affected by this parameter.

        reach (float, default=None= :math:`+\infty` ): If **loss** is ``"sinkhorn"``
            or ``"hausdorff"``,
            specifies the typical scale :math:`\\tau` associated
            to the constraint strength :math:`\\rho = \\tau^p`.

        diameter (float, default=None): A rough indication of the maximum
            distance between points, which is used to tune the :math:`\\varepsilon`-scaling
            descent and provide a default heuristic for clustering **multiscale** schemes.
            If **None**, a conservative estimate will be computed on-the-fly.

        scaling (float, default=.5): If **loss** is ``"sinkhorn"``,
            specifies the ratio between successive values
            of :math:`\sigma=\\varepsilon^{1/p}` in the
            :math:`\\varepsilon`-scaling descent.
            This parameter allows you to specify the trade-off between
            speed (**scaling** < .4) and accuracy (**scaling** > .9).

        truncate (float, default=None= :math:`+\infty`): If **backend**
            is ``"multiscale"``, specifies the effective support of
            a Gaussian/Laplacian kernel as a multiple of its standard deviation.
            If **truncate** is not **None**, kernel truncation
            steps will assume that
            :math:`\\exp(-x/\sigma)` or
            :math:`\\exp(-x^2/2\sigma^2) are zero when
            :math:`\|x\| \,>\, \\text{truncate}\cdot \sigma`.


        cost (function or string, default=None): if **loss** is ``"sinkhorn"``
            or ``"hausdorff"``, specifies the cost function that should
            be used instead of :math:`\\tfrac{1}{p}\|x-y\|^p`:

            - If **backend** is ``"tensorized"``, **cost** should be a
              python function that takes as input a
              (B,N,D) torch Tensor **x**, a (B,M,D) torch Tensor **y**
              and returns a batched Cost matrix as a (B,N,M) Tensor.
            - Otherwise, if **backend** is ``"online"`` or ``"multiscale"``,
              **cost** should be a `KeOps formula <http://www.kernel-operations.io/api/math-operations.html>`_,
              given as a string, with variables ``X`` and ``Y``.
              The default values are ``"Norm2(X-Y)"`` (for **p** = 1) and
              ``"(SqDist(X,Y) / IntCst(2))"`` (for **p** = 2).

        cluster_scale (float, default=None): If **backend** is ``"multiscale"``,
            specifies the coarse scale at which cluster centroids will be computed.
            If **None**, a conservative estimate will be computed from
            **diameter** and the ambient space's dimension,
            making sure that memory overflows won't take place.

        debias (bool, default=True): If **loss** is ``"sinkhorn"``,
            specifies if we should compute the **unbiased**
            Sinkhorn divergence instead of the classic,
            entropy-regularized "SoftAssign" loss.

        potentials (bool, default=False): When this parameter is set to True,
            the :mod:`SamplesLoss` layer returns a pair of optimal dual potentials
            :math:`F` and :math:`G`, sampled on the input measures,
            instead of differentiable scalar value.
            These dual vectors :math:`(F(x_i))` and :math:`(G(y_j))`
            are encoded as Torch tensors, with the same shape
            as the input weights :math:`(\\alpha_i)` and :math:`(\\beta_j)`.

        verbose (bool, default=False): If **backend** is ``"multiscale"``,
            specifies whether information on the clustering and
            :math:`\\varepsilon`-scaling descent should be displayed
            in the standard output.

        backend (string, default = ``"auto"``): The implementation that
            will be used in the background; this choice has a major impact
            on performance. The supported values are:

              - ``"auto"``: Choose automatically, using a simple
                heuristic based on the inputs' shapes.
              - ``"tensorized"``: Relies on a full cost/kernel matrix, computed
                once and for all and stored on the device memory.
                This method is fast, but has a quadratic
                memory footprint and does not scale beyond ~5,000 samples per measure.
              - ``"online"``: Computes cost/kernel values on-the-fly, leveraging
                online map-reduce CUDA routines provided by
                the `pykeops <https://www.kernel-operations.io>`_ library.
              - ``"multiscale"``: Fast implementation that scales to millions
                of samples in dimension 1-2-3, relying on the block-sparse
                reductions provided by the `pykeops <https://www.kernel-operations.io>`_ library.
